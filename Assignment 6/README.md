# CS 3200 HW 6 IMDb queries

* Use this repository to build the SQL queries that retrieve the information requested by each of the HW problems
* The `expected` folder has the `CSV` files with the expected output of each of your queries
* The `submission` folder has empty `SQL` files, one for each of the problems. Use these files to build the SQL query that will eventually be what you submit
* You should continue to use the `derbydiff` program distributed with the previous homework to compare the expected output to the output of your SQL queries.
